# Final Project 
Hey guys, I just wanted to check in about the website.
Our website is about the Champions League and the teams that have won the champions league trophy. The theme of the site will be something like ‘Champions League Legends’. We are going to focus on the leagues top 5 teams first (Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool), and if we have the time we will add all of them.
Content for the Website will include a homepage about the Champions League, the other pages will link to a soccer team:
### Homepage: 
* Navigation
* Action shot image with the Champions League Logo
* About the Champions League (5-6 lines of what the league is)
### Teams that are in the League
* Schedule of soccer games
### Team Pages:
* Team logo and number of times they have won the Champions League trophy on top of a banner image
* Roster of the teams that won the championship that year. The roster will include a headshot image and player's bio (Hometown, position, jersey number, # of years they have been playing pro)
* Strategy section - shows what formation the team plays in
* Stadium Features - Capacity and location

### Footer: Schedule of upcoming soccer games
This week we should all work on something so here is what I had in mind:
Rocky, color palette and font research
Piyoros, find websites that include rosters (players bio) and stadium info for the top 5 teams (Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool) and put them in a list so we can input content for the site.
I will work on the wireframes this week so we have a sense of where everything will be placed on the site.
Please feel free to add anything else.
